# 👋 Hi there! I'm Juanlu

Welcome to my GitHub.

I'm a software developer and technical architect specialized in Microsoft technologies — particularly .NET, Azure, and DevOps. I'm passionate about building clean, scalable, and efficient solutions — from simple APIs to distributed systems with microservices, running on AKS and fully automated through Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

In this GitHub you'll find a mix of real-world tools, experiments, and reusable building blocks — everything I find useful and solid enough to share. I love to dig into architecture, automation, good practices, and learning by doing.

- 💻 .NET (C#, ASP.NET Core, Minimal APIs, xUnit)
- ☁️ Azure (AKS, App Services, CosmosDB, API Management, Functions)
